### Introduction
Assignment overview:
> In this assignment, you will learn about the programming skills required for CVWOâ€™ssummer project and go through a website development cycle. The focus of this assignmentis to promote proper code structure, coding techniques and familiarity withvarious development tools. You are expected to build up a good web developmentfoundation through this assignment, and prepare yourself for one development cycleduring your stint over the summer.

This assignment was basically for me to learn the ropes of web development and hopefully get an opportunity for an intership with a VWO.
I have hosted the web application on Heroku [here](https://whispering-everglades-24844.herokuapp.com).

### Technologies
- Ruby 2.6.5
- Rails 6
- Bootstrap 4
- Hosted on Heroku

### Usage
The task manager is a very simple web application. It provides basic creating, reading, updating and deleting functionality. In addition, I have added an email reminder functionality which will remind you of the task at a certain time.
